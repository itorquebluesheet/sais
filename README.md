# sais
An extremely simple tool for checking the size of all files inside a directory and its subdirectories on linux.
Note that this tool is very untested and its code is very low quality.
It can be used to check the size of files inside of a directory.

It probably has a lot of bugs so don't rely on this for important things.

Compile it with:
gcc sais.c -o sais

And install with superuser rights with:
cp sais /usr/bin
